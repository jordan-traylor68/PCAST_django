"The novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (2009-H1N1) appeared in Mexico in April 2009 and was declared a level 6 pandemic by the World Health Organization in June 2009. This report delivered to President Barack Obama includes observations, conclusions, and recommendations from the Presidents's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) 2009-H1N1 Working Group. The group offers insights and analysis on eight major points: the United States' experience with influenza in the 20th century; a potential resurgence of 2009-H1N1 in the fall of 2009; aspects of influenza activity surveillance; the United States' response to the pandemic; minimizing financial and organizational costs of pandemic response; improving both government and public communication concerning pandemics; and improving overall influenza response planning and strategy. The report advances several recommendations based on these analyses, including the creation of logistical plans, acceleration of vaccine production, and encouragement of multi-agency response efforts."	pcast0001	eng	Rice University	20090807	This material is in the public domain and may be freely used.

The Presidents's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) argues that this practice stands in contrast to the federal government's approach that uses static precautionsù and other mechanisms to mandate cybersecurity measures that evolve only in iterative and not dynamic ways. To remedy this, PCAST recommends that the federal government enact a new cybersecurity strategy that involves adopting best practices, third-party auditing of federal cybersecurity systems, and improving the government's real-time cybersecurity capabilities."	pcast0018	eng	Rice University	201311	This material is in the public domain and may be freely used.

In response to President Barack Obamas charge to identify additional actions to strengthen forensic science, the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) determined that there are two gaps in existing practices: 1) lack of clarification of standards for the validity and reliability of forensic methods, and 2) lack of thorough evaluation of all forensic methods for their scientific merit to be valid and reliable. PCAST provides criteria under which scientific validity for forensic science in numerous feature-comparisonù methods can be judged and evaluates existing practices of those fields by those standards.

The Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) argues that three key policy pillars will best orient the United States to engage with these IotF: improving multi-sector engagement in innovation, creating a new research institute structure that integrates comprehensive engagement with one of these industries, and building up a capable and diverse workforce. Pursuant to these policies, PCAST recommends that the federal government increase investment in artificial intelligence research and development (R&D) by a factor of ten by 2030, create distinct yet collaborative IotF-focused research institutes, and improve education and workforce opportunities for both science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals and non-STEM professionals."	pcast0063	eng	Rice University	19950711	This material is in the public domain and may be freely used.
