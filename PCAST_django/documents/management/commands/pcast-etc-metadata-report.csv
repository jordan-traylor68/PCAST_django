This report delivered to President Barack Obama includes observations, conclusions, and recommendations from the Presidents's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) 2009-H1N1 Working Group. The group offers insights and analysis on eight major points: the United States' experience with influenza in the 20th century; a potential resurgence of 2009-H1N1 in the fall of 2009; aspects of influenza activity surveillance; the United States' response to the pandemic; minimizing financial and organizational costs of pandemic response; improving both government and public communication concerning pandemics; and improving overall influenza response planning and strategy. The report advances several recommendations based on these analyses, including the creation of logistical plans, acceleration of vaccine production, and encouragement of multi-agency response efforts."	pcast0001	eng	Rice University	20090807	This material is in the public domain and may be freely used.

While IT has had a profound impact on many sectors of the economy, several factors have softened this impact on healthcare systems, including proprietary data systems, lack of incentives for accessibility to medical records, and concerns about privacy. Recognizing these factors, the Presidents's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) work toward creating a universal exchange language for health IT and that the federal government invests further in health IT."	pcast0005	eng	Rice University	201010	This material is in the public domain and may be freely used.

In response to President Barack Obamas charge to identify additional actions to strengthen forensic science, the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) determined that there are two gaps in existing practices: 1) lack of clarification of standards for the validity and reliability of forensic methods, and 2) lack of thorough evaluation of all forensic methods for their scientific merit to be valid and reliable. PCAST provides criteria under which scientific validity for forensic science in numerous feature-comparison� methods can be judged and evaluates existing practices of those fields by those standards.
